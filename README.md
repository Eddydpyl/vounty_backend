# Vounty

[Vounty](https://vounty.io/) is the place where you can create, fund and lay claim to virtual bounties (known as vounties). A bounty is a payment or reward, often offered by a group, as an incentive for the accomplishment of a particular task. A vounty is the same, but online and democratized. Anyone can start, fund and claim vounties.

This is the code repository for the Vounty backend. Along with the [website code](https://github.com/Eddydpyl/vounty_web), it's what makes Vounty tick.
